**Hi, this is my pet-project -> Blog.**

For my project, I chose a blog, classic. On my blog site, you can register and authenticate. After that you can write your post. Then you can also change it. Every post has comments, and likes. You can see the posts of other users, and display them in a convenient manner. For the blog I used Django, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap. For blog hosting, I used the services pythonanywhere and heroku
